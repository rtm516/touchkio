# Supported Hardware
This document contains an incomplete list of device and display hardware combinations that have already been tested.

The [release](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/releases) page has builds exclusively for **arm64** and **x64**, but custom builds for other architectures can be made (see [development](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio?tab=readme-ov-file#development)), allowing the application to operate on any hardware.
At least the **minimal** features, such as displaying a **kiosk window** (which doesn't necessarily need to be Home Assistant) will work.

## Hardware
If you are running Linux with a graphical user interface (Wayland or X11), you should be well equipped to use the application. Additionally, any single board computer (SBC) clones of the Raspberry Pi that operate on Raspberry Pi OS **(64-bit)** are likely to function as well.

## Features
**Minimal features** are designed to run on any system without issues:
- A webview kiosk window launched in fullscreen mode and loading the specified `--web-url` website should not cause any problems.

**Extended features** become available when the `--mqtt-*` arguments are provided and the hardware is supported:
- If your hardware is not fully compatible there should be no crashes, but you may miss some sensors.

Hardware support is verified during application startup and can be checked in the terminal or in the log file under the `Supported` section.
The necessary requirements for MQTT sensors to work are listed here:

## FAQ

### Operating System

<details><summary>I have installed Ubuntu GNOME.</summary>

  - On some Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu GNOME), the display status control is only available when using X11 (`xset`).
  - GNOME running on Wayland is the least supported window manager.
    - It's recommended to switch to KDE Wayland, if you want proper support for display status control (`kscreen-doctor`).
    - If you enjoy GNOME Wayland and suffering, install [ddcutil](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/pull/194) instead.

</details>

<details><summary>I have installed Raspberry Pi OS Lite.</summary>

  - Starting with Raspberry Pi OS Lite is not recommended, use the default desktop image instead (not Lite/Full).
    - Display and Keyboard MQTT controls may [not work](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/239#issuecomment-5422999509) on Lite installs.

</details>

<details><summary>I have installed Raspberry Pi OS on a RPI3.</summary>

  - Raspberry Pi 3 devices have produced a bunch of issues in the past.
    - [RPI 3B thermostat card issue](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/17).
    - [RPI 3B wayland rendering issue](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/104).    
    - [Webpage cards don't work (RPI 3B)](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/24).
 - It looks like the GPU is not properly supported by Electron.
    - Running `touchkio --disable-gpu` may improve the situation, but upgrading the hardware is the best solution.

</details>

<details><summary>I want to update APT packages automatically.</summary>

  - The **Package Upgrades** MQTT sensor will show if `apt` package upgrades are available, but updates are [intentionally](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/7) not triggered by TouchKio.
  - It's recommended to keep your system up to date for security and compatibility, as TouchKio primarily supports the latest OS versions. 
    - Consider configuring `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades` for automatic updates.

</details>

### Display

<details><summary>Display status can't be controlled through MQTT.</summary>

  - The following commands are currently implemented to modify the display status. Make sure that one of these works for your display when you run it directly on the terminal, otherwise the MQTT switch will not work either.
    - `wlopm --[on,off] \*` (Raspberry Pi OS, Wayland)
    - `kscreen-doctor --dpms [on,off]` (Debian KDE, Wayland)
    - `xset dpms force [on,off]` (Generic, X11)
  - If none of the above commands are available on your system consider installing another OS. There is a built-in command prioritization in case [ddcutil](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/pull/194) is installed, but it's really slow and unreliable.
    - `sudo ddcutil setvcp D6 0x04` turns off your screen [without asking](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) for a password.
    - `sudo ddcutil setvcp D6 0x01` turns on your screen [without asking](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) for a password.

</details>

<details><summary>Display brightness can't be controlled through MQTT.</summary>

  - Have a look at the [features](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/blob/main/HARDWARE.md#features) section to check if all requirements are fulfilled.
    - The **Display** MQTT control is a light entity with brightness support. So make sure to [click on the entity](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/75) to test the brightness slider.
    - The brightness slider is also only available if the display status control (on/off) is functional and the [user has permissions](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) to modify the brightness value.
  - HDMI screens typically do not offer brightness control out of the box, so additional setup steps are required.
    - It's recommended to install [ddcci-driver-linux](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/132#issue-3659009749) or [ddcci-dkms](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/101#issuecomment-3571523927), since this will create the necessary `/sys/class/backlight/*` folder structure.
    - Additional brightness support using [ddcutil](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/101#issuecomment-3521247263) is built-in and checked on application startup, but it's really slow and unreliable.
  - Make sure that one of these works for your display when you run it directly on the terminal, otherwise the MQTT switch will not show the brightness control.
    - `sudo cat /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness` returns some numeric value.
    - `sudo ddcutil setvcp 10 42` changes the brightness to 42% [without asking](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) for a password.

</details>

<details><summary>Turning HDMI screen off via MQTT causes it to turn back on.</summary>

  - There are certain HDMI screens where the MQTT display status command doesn't work as expected. 
    - The screen **immediately turns on again**, which may be caused by [incompatible HDMI](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/38#issuecomment-3341641642) cables being used.
    - Forcing [hotplug](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/38#issuecomment-3347732956) may also help, but consider checking your HDMI cable connection and [display settings](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/131#issuecomment-4026027425) first.

</details>

<details><summary>Using a GPIO/PWM/USB power controlled screen.</summary>

  - Controlling the screen via [USB](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/119) hub power, [PWM](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/190) backlight or [GPIO](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/152) is not planned.

</details>

### Touch

<details><summary>Automated screen blanking on inactivity.</summary>

  - You can use Raspberry Pi's built-in [screen blanking](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#screen-blanking-3) functionality, however, if the screen is turned on through Home Assistant after being automatically turned off, it will remain on indefinitely.
    - It's recommended to either use the built-in screen blanking feature or implement a Home Assistant [automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/basics) (e.g. presence detection or **Last Active** MQTT sensor) to manage the screen status.

</details>

<details><summary>Touch in multitouch mode not waking the screen.</summary>

  - It's recommended to use **Mouse Emulation** for touch screens, otherwise touch based [screen wake-up](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/127) from display off state will fail, especially if built-in [screen blanking](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#screen-blanking-3) is disabled.

</details>

<details><summary>Touch events may propagate through a display that is turned off.</summary>

  - It's recommended to use **Mouse Emulation** for touch screens, otherwise Home Assistant actions could be triggered [unintentionally](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/61) on touch.

</details>

<details><summary>The on-screen keyboard doesn't automatically pop-out.</summary>

  - Most of the available on-screen keyboards will not render above any [fullscreen window](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2327148).
  - There is a [workaround](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/85) for `squeekboard`, which will only work on Raspberry Pi OS.
    - If the on-screen keyboard still doesn't [automatically pop-out](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/4) when entering a text field inside the webview you can use the side [widget](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/16) to toggle the visibility.

</details>

### Network

<details><summary>Connecting via https/mqtts with a self-signed certificate.</summary>

  - When connecting to a service with a [custom certificate](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/42#issuecomment-3041870215), ensure the specified FQDN matches.
    - Using the `--ignore-certificate-errors` flag is [not recommended](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/76) for browsing external sites.

</details>

<details><summary>During VNC access the display control fails.</summary>

  - On Raspberry Pi OS the display command may [fail](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio#the-nitty-gritty) with `ERROR: Setting power mode for output '[DSI-*,HDMI-*]' failed`.
    - This can happen if you have `wayvnc` running for remote access and is [known](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/78#issuecomment-3316245615) behavior.
    - Don't use VNC except when needed to initially setting up the device.

</details>

<details><summary>Local DNS entries in /etc/hosts are ignored.</summary>

  - Electron bypasses the system resolver stack, ignoring `/etc/hosts` and local DNS servers.
    - To use the system resolver, modify `~/.config/systemd/user/touchkio.service` to disable these features:
    ```bash
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/touchkio --disable-features=UseDNSHttps,AsyncDns
    ```

</details>

<details><summary>Starting TouchKio from a SSH terminal.</summary>

  - Electron needs a graphical session, the required exports are logged in the terminal.
    - You can start `touchkio.service` after `--setup` has finished, otherwise default arguments are missing.
    - Add `--ozone-platform=wayland` for on-screen keyboard [auto pop-out](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/85) support.

</details>

### Media

<details><summary>I need Music and Voice Assistant.</summary>

  - Not planned, look for [alternatives](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/88#issuecomment-3366659265).

</details>

<details><summary>I need a camera stream from the device.</summary>

  - Not planned, look for [alternatives](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/130#issuecomment-3591770594).

</details>

<details><summary>I need additional MQTT entities to control hardware.</summary>

  - Not planned, look for [alternatives](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/138#issuecomment-3591784725).

</details>

<details><summary>Some music/movie focused websites do not load correctly.</summary>

  - Sites like Spotify and Disney+ need Widevine (DRM), which is [not supported](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/188#issuecomment-5619996374) in the foreseeable future.

</details>

### Dependencies

<details><summary>Some of the MQTT controls are missing.</summary>

  - Certain [features](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/blob/main/HARDWARE.md#features) from the MQTT integration may require elevated privileges to work correctly.
    - Test if your local user has the [necessary permissions](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) to run `sudo -n true` without being [prompted for a password](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/116#issuecomment-3471566411).
  - Check the `Supported` section on the terminal or via `cat ~/.config/touchkio/logs/main.log` and look for `access.sudo` to be `true`.
  
</details>

<details><summary>Assign granular access to MQTT commands.</summary>

  - Instead of granting `NOPASSWD: ALL` you may want to [restrict access](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) to the `sudo` commands you actually need.
    - Replace `user` with the output of `whoami`, then run `sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/touchkio` and add:
      ```bash
      user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: \
        /usr/sbin/reboot, \
        /usr/sbin/shutdown, \
        /usr/bin/apt install
      ```
  - Restart TouchKio and check `access.reboot`, `access.shutdown` and `access.install` in the log.

</details>

<details><summary>The ddcutil command doesn't seem to be used.</summary>

  - Currently `ddcutil` can be optionally installed to control HDMI screens.
    - Test if your local user has the [necessary permissions](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39#issuecomment-4470939733) to run `sudo -n true` without being [prompted for a password](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/116#issuecomment-3471566411).
    - Make sure that your screen is supporting [continuous](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/101#issuecomment-3521247263) adjustments of brightness.
  - On Raspberry Pi OS the built-in screen blanking (`wlopm`) may fail when `ddcutil` was used to alter the screen state.

</details>

<details><summary>Unicode Emoji characters are not rendered correctly.</summary>

  - Depending on your OS you may need to install some [extra packages](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/209#issuecomment-4477980609).

</details>

### Errors

<details><summary>Error message "Setting power mode for output * failed".</summary>

  - The display command `wlopm` may fail with this error while a VNC client is connected.
    - This is [known](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/78#issuecomment-3316245615) behavior, also documented in the [README](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio#the-nitty-gritty).
    - Don't use VNC except when needed to initially setting up the device.

</details>

<details><summary>Error message "GPU Process abnormal-exit".</summary>

  - _GPU Process abnormal-exit (code 512)_ means that the Electron GPU process crashed, probably caused by some issues inside the webview.
    - Disabling the GPU via `touchkio --disable-gpu` may help.
 
</details>

<details><summary>Error message "Render Process killed".</summary>

  - _Render Process killed (code 9)_ will lead to a temporary [white screen](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/115).
  - The problem likely stems from Electron’s calculated RAM limit (~2GB) and the dashboard using too much memory.
    - Although there are flags to [increase the limit](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/36#issuecomment-3406441947), a standard webview shouldn’t require that much RAM.

</details>

<details><summary>CPU and RAM usage increases without reason.</summary>

  - This was [especially observed](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/123) when the screen is permanently on and renders a dashboard with interactive elements (e.g. custom lovelace cards).  
    - Switching to another **Page Url** or turning the **Display** off during idle times improves resource usage.  
    - Alternatively a timed **Refresh** of the webview via MQTT can also help.

</details>

## Contributions
In case your hardware is not listed above don't worry, give it a try.
Running `touchkio --web-url=https://demo.home-assistant.io` will most likely just work.
The only problems that may arise are when controlling the display via the Home Assistant integration.

There is a possibility to test `pre-releases` if you would like to try upcoming versions before the official release is published.
These early builds are available to a smaller group of users who have chosen to take part in testing.

If you are interested in long-term testing, check out the related [help request](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/96).
When a [pre-release](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/releases) is available and you want to test it on-demand, run:
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leukipp/touchkio/main/install.sh) update early
